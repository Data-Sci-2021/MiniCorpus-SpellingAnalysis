## Naturalistic spelling errors in L2 English learners across three L1s

**Brief summary:** For my dissertation, I collected a wide range of lexical measures from four language groups: L1 English speakers, plus L2 English users from three L1 backgrounds (Spanish, Hebrew, and Chinese) to allow for cross-linguistic comparisons across learners from different writing system backgrounds. Although I was not smart enough at the time to directly collect purposeful spelling data, I do have participant productions from two tasks: a productive [vocabulary levels test](https://www.lextutor.ca/tests/levels/productive/) and a language history questionnaire. Although these are definitely limited samples, I will be exploring the accuracy of participant spellings in these two data sources, as well as possibly what types of patterns might exist with regard to the _types_ spelling errors produced by participants. In particular, I will be looking to see whether there are variations across L1 groups.

**Data structure:** A few years ago I had a research assistant transcribe participants' hand-written productions on these two tasks into an Excel file, with each word on a separate row. I have the first row (first word) for each participant labeled with the participant number and the task (vocabulary levels test or language history questionnaire), but these labels need to be applied to all relevant rows/rows for each participant. I also have information on participants' language backgrounds, cognitive individual differences (working memory, executive function), years of English study, English listening comprehension, and English reading comprehension, all in a separate file that I would want to link to the mini corpus. I'll need to get these files wrangled to link the appropriate pieces, and I'll potentially need to compare the participant word-level productions to an existing word list (though I did also have the RA mark misspellings manually, I'd like to try automating this). Overall, the Excel file has 36,176 rows (words) of data.

**Analysis:** The primary goal of looking at this data would be to see whether spelling accuracy (rate) differs across L1 groups. Based on the influence of L1 writing system on L2 English spelling, my expectation would be that L1 English speakers would have the highest accuracy, followed by the L1 Chinese speakers, and then the L1 Hebrew and L1 French speakers (who would likely be at roughly the same overall accuracy). I would also expect qualitative differences in the _types_ of errors across groups, but that might be beyond what I could do for this class (in terms of data wrangling) - in other words, I think my only/best option for looking at that is manual coding of error types. I think my best analytical approach would be to do some variation of Poisson regression, with the count of spelling errors as the outcome (though I have to think about how best to account for the overall length of productions, especially on the language history questionnaire, which can vary substantially across participants). I still need to think about this a bit more.
