* Created my GitHub repo for the project today
* Cleaned up my project idea and turned it into the project_plan.md file - **needs to be uploaded to GitHub**
* Created a blank LICENSE.md file - **needs to be completed and also needs to be added to GitHub**
* Added a gitignore.md file - **needs to have the Mac-specific stuff added to it, plus the /private directory**
* Added a basic README.md file
